# Ruby on Rails Tutorial (adapted for Django): sample application

I want to learn Django. I've been through the Rails Tutorial before
and found it useful to figure out how all the pieces worked together.
So, I'm going to follow the
[Ruby on Rails Tutorial](http://railstutorial.org), but try to figure
out how to do the equivalent actions in Django. I'm not going to be
100% faithful, just enough to teach my what I'm doing.
